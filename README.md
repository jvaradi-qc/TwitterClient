# Project 2 - *TwitterClient*

**NTwitterClient** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

  - [x] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- [x] User can refresh tweets timeline by pulling down to refresh

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I found it quite challenging figuring out how to improve the pull to refresh functionality to only pull latest Tweets and add them to the existing list using since_id param.  

Also had a lot of difficulty trying to add a Twitter image icon in place of the text label on the ActionBar.
